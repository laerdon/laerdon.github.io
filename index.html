    <h2>what i'm up to</h2>

    <p>
      This summer, I'll be working as a research intern funded by the <b>Bowers Undergraduate Research Experience (BURE)</b> program at Cornell.
      I'll be working further with Prof. Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, developing forecasting models to determine when and how tension builds in online conversation.

        <li>I <a href="https://soundcloud.com/yskinprogress/" target="_blank">produce music</a> in Ableton, occasionally contributing samples of my cello.</li>
        <li>I sketch. I have a lot of MUJI pens, too.</li>
        <li>I like to grill, and bake cupcakes, pies, and custard-related desserts. I once made an <a href="{{ '/assets/images/pie.JPG' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">algae-colored pumpkin pie</a>.</li>
        <li>In summer 2024, I started a blog on <a href="https://laerdon.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>.</li>
