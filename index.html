      <p>
        Hi! I'm Laerdon Kim, a rising sophomore at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
        I'm interested in <b>NLP for long-term social/scientific collaboration with AI agents</b> and <b>investigating language model embeddings</b>.
        My research advisors are <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/" target="_blank">Professor Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/" target="_blank">Professor Lillian Lee</a>.
